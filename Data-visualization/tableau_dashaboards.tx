To create dashboards using Tableau Server, follow these steps:

Connect to Data Sources:

Open Tableau Desktop or navigate to the web interface of Tableau Server.
Connect to the data sources that you published earlier on Tableau Server. These data sources contain the data from your Redshift database.
Use the published data sources to build your visualizations and dashboards.
Design Dashboards:

Design the layout of your dashboards by arranging sheets, visualizations, and other elements.
Create calculated fields as needed to perform additional analysis or calculations on the data.
Add interactivity to your dashboards by using filters, parameters, and actions. This allows users to explore the data and drill down into specific details.
Build Visualizations:

Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, maps, and tables to represent your data.
Choose appropriate visualization types based on the insights you want to convey and the characteristics of your data.
Customize the appearance and formatting of your visualizations to improve clarity and readability.
Publish Dashboards to Tableau Server:

Once you've designed your dashboards in Tableau Desktop or the web interface, publish them to Tableau Server.
In Tableau Desktop, navigate to the "Server" menu and select "Publish Workbook" to upload the dashboard to Tableau Server.
Choose the appropriate Tableau Server project where you want to publish the dashboard.
Provide any additional metadata and permissions settings, then click "Publish" to upload the dashboard to Tableau Server.
Share and Collaborate:

Once the dashboards are published to Tableau Server, users with appropriate permissions can access and interact with them.
Share the dashboard links or embed them in web pages or applications for wider distribution.
Collaborate with colleagues by commenting on dashboards, sharing insights, and collaborating on data analysis projects.
By following these steps, you can create interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau Server, connect them to your Redshift data sources, and share insights with your team for informed decision-making.
