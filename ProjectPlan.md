# Project Plan

## Setup PostgreSQL Database in AWS

1. Provision a PostgreSQL database instance in AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).
2. Configure security groups, access control, and backups according to best practices.

## File Ingestion and Processing with Airflow and PySpark

1. Create Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to schedule and orchestrate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
2. Use Python operators within Airflow DAGs to connect to the EC2 Linux server, pull parquet files, and process them using PySpark.
3. Implement error handling and retries within Airflow tasks to ensure fault tolerance and data consistency.

## Data Transformation with dbt

1. Install and configure dbt (data build tool) in AWS infrastructure.
2. Define dbt models to transform raw data from parquet files into analysis-ready datasets.
3. Utilize dbt's version control and testing features to ensure data quality and reproducibility of transformations.

## Data Warehouse Setup and Analysis

1. Create tables in AWS Redshift or Athena to serve as the data warehouse for storing transformed data.
2. Write SQL queries to perform data analysis and generate insights from the data warehouse.
3. Use Redshift Spectrum or Athena's federated query capabilities to analyze data directly from S3 without loading it into the data warehouse.

## Report Generation and Distribution

1. Develop Python scripts or Airflow tasks to generate CSV reports containing analyzed data.
2. Store the generated reports in S3 buckets for easy access by business analysts.
3. Implement notification mechanisms to alert stakeholders when new reports are available.

## Integration with Postgres DB

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database instance in AWS to store refined and transformed data.
2. Configure database tables to store data in a structured format suitable for consumption.
3. Use Python scripts or Airflow tasks to write transformed data to Postgres tables.

## Fraud Detection and Model Deployment

1. Feed data into Kafka topics using Kafka producers connected to PySpark or other ETL processes.
2. Develop microservices or serverless functions to consume data from Kafka topics and run fraud detection models.
3. Deploy fraud detection models using containerization (e.g., Docker) or serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track the performance and health of the data pipeline.
2. Use AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or other monitoring tools to monitor Airflow, database performance, and application logs.

## Documentation and Testing

1. Document the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details of the data pipeline.
2. Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the correctness and reliability of the pipeline.
3. Document data lineage, data flow, and dependencies between components.
