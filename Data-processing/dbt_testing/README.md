Testing: dbt allows you to define tests to validate the output of your models and ensure data quality and integrity. Tests are written using SQL queries and are executed against the output of your models. Common types of tests include schema tests, which validate the structure of the output data, and data tests, which validate the contents of the output data. Here's an example of a schema test:
sql
Copy code
-- model_1.sql
select *
from source_table
sql
Copy code
-- schema_test.sql
select count(*)
from {{ ref('model_1') }}
where column_name is null
In this example, the schema test checks for null values in a specific column of the output data produced by model_1.
