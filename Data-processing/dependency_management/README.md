#Dependency Management: 

In dbt, you can specify dependencies between your models using the ref and source directives. The ref directive specifies a dependency on another model, while the source directive specifies a dependency on a source table or view. By defining these dependencies, dbt can determine the correct order in which to execute your models, ensuring that upstream models are executed before downstream models that depend on them. Here's an example:

#-- model_1.sql
select *
from {{ ref('model_2') }}

#-- model_2.sql
select *
from source_table
In this example, model_1 depends on model_2, so dbt will ensure that model_2 is executed before model_1.
