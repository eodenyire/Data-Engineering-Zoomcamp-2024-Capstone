Documentation: dbt allows you to document your models using Markdown files. These documentation files describe the purpose, inputs, outputs, and any other relevant information about your models. Documentation files are stored in the docs directory of your dbt project and can be viewed using the dbt docs generate command. Here's an example of a documentation file:
markdown
Copy code
# model_1.md

## Description

This model retrieves data from the source_table.

## Inputs

- `source_table`: The source table containing the input data.

## Outputs

- `model_1`: The transformed data output by this model.
By documenting your models, you make your data transformations more transparent and understandable to other team members.

With these additional components in place, you'll have a comprehensive data transformation pipeline using dbt.
