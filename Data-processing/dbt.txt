DBT (data build tool) is primarily used for data transformation, not for loading data into Redshift. Typically, you would use DBT to transform raw data from your source (such as Parquet files stored in S3) into analysis-ready datasets. These transformed datasets can then be loaded into Redshift.

Here's a typical workflow:

Extract: Your raw data resides in Parquet files stored in S3 or some other storage location.
Transform: You use DBT to apply transformations to this raw data, such as cleaning, aggregating, or joining different datasets.
Load: Once the data is transformed, you load the transformed datasets into Redshift tables using COPY commands or other data loading mechanisms provided by Redshift.
So, to answer your question:

You would use DBT to transform the data from your Parquet files into analysis-ready datasets.
After transformation, you would load the transformed datasets into Redshift tables from the S3 location where DBT stores the results.
The loading of data into Redshift typically happens after the transformation step, not directly from DBT.


Let's break down the process of using DBT to transform data and then push the transformed files to S3:

Transform Data with DBT:

First, ensure you have DBT installed and configured on your system or server.
Define your DBT models in your DBT project. These models represent the transformations you want to apply to your raw data.
Write SQL queries in your DBT models to perform the required transformations. This may include cleaning, aggregating, joining, or deriving new columns from your raw data.
Organize your DBT project structure with folders for models, tests, and macros as needed.
Use DBT's configuration files (dbt_project.yml, profiles.yml) to specify settings such as your target warehouse (Redshift) and connection details.
Run DBT to Transform Data:

Use the DBT command-line interface (CLI) to run your DBT project. For example, you can use commands like dbt run to execute the transformations defined in your DBT models.
DBT will execute the SQL queries defined in your models and generate transformed datasets based on your transformations.
After the DBT run completes successfully, the transformed datasets will be stored in the designated target location, which can be configured in your DBT project settings.
Push Transformed Files to S3:

Configure DBT to output the transformed datasets to an S3 bucket. You can specify the S3 target location in your DBT project settings or in your individual models.
When DBT runs, it will upload the transformed datasets to the specified S3 bucket.
Ensure that the IAM role or user credentials used by DBT have the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket.
Load Data into Redshift from S3:

Configure your Redshift cluster to access the S3 bucket where the transformed datasets are stored. This involves setting up an IAM role for Redshift with permissions to read from the S3 bucket.
Write COPY commands in Redshift to load data from the S3 bucket into Redshift tables. These COPY commands will specify the location of the data files in S3 and the target tables in Redshift.
By following these steps, you can effectively use DBT to transform your data and then load the transformed datasets into Redshift from S3.
