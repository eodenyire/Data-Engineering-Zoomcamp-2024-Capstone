"""
The dbt_project.yml file is a YAML configuration file that defines various project-level settings for your dbt project. Here's a basic example of what this file might look like for your project:
"""

name: my_project
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

profile: 'default'

source-paths: ["models"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
target-path: "target"

clean-targets:
  - "target"

"""

Let's break down each section of this file:

name: This specifies the name of your dbt project.
version: This specifies the version of your dbt project.
config-version: This specifies the version of the dbt configuration format being used. In this case, it's set to 2.
profile: This specifies the name of the profile to use for connecting to your target database. The profile details are typically defined in the profiles.yml file.
source-paths: This specifies the directories where your dbt models are located. In this example, the models are located in a directory named models.
analysis-paths: This specifies the directories where your dbt analysis files are located. Analysis files contain SQL queries for ad-hoc analysis.
test-paths: This specifies the directories where your dbt test files are located. Test files contain SQL queries for testing the output of your models.
target-path: This specifies the directory where dbt will output compiled SQL files and other artifacts. In this example, the artifacts will be stored in a directory named target.
clean-targets: This specifies the directories or files that should be cleaned (deleted) when running the dbt clean command. In this example, the target directory will be cleaned.
You can customize these settings according to your project requirements. Once you've configured your dbt_project.yml file, dbt will use these settings when running your dbt project.
