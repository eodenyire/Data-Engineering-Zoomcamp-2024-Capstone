 If the parquet files are being pulled from the EC2 source and dumped into the same EC2 server where Airflow is provisioned, then yes, the scripts (both Python and bash) will be executing from that location.

In that case, you can update the placeholder script to reflect the local directory path where the parquet files will be stored on the EC2 server. Here's the updated placeholder bash script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Connection details for the Redshift cluster
REDSHIFT_HOST="your_redshift_host"
REDSHIFT_PORT="5439"
REDSHIFT_DB="your_redshift_database"
REDSHIFT_USER="your_redshift_user"
REDSHIFT_PASSWORD="your_redshift_password"

# Directory where parquet files are stored on the EC2 server
PARQUET_DIR="/path/to/parquet/files"

# Placeholder command to connect to Redshift
echo "Connecting to Redshift..."
# Replace the command below with the appropriate command to connect to Redshift
# Example: psql -h $REDSHIFT_HOST -p $REDSHIFT_PORT -d $REDSHIFT_DB -U $REDSHIFT_USER -c "your_sql_command_here"

# Placeholder command to pull and process parquet files
echo "Pulling and processing parquet files..."
# Replace the command below with the appropriate command to pull and process parquet files
# Example: your_script_to_pull_and_process_parquet_files.py

# Placeholder command to write processed data to Redshift
echo "Writing processed data to Redshift..."
# Replace the command below with the appropriate command to write processed data to Redshift
# Example: your_script_to_write_to_redshift.py
Ensure that the placeholder command to pull and process parquet files (your_script_to_pull_and_process_parquet_files.py) actually copies the files from the EC2 source to the local directory specified by PARQUET_DIR and processes them as needed.
