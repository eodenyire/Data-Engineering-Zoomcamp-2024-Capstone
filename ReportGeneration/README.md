# Report Generation and Distribution

In this section, we outline the process of generating CSV reports containing analyzed data and distributing them to stakeholders efficiently. The process involves developing Python scripts or Airflow DAGs, scheduling their execution, extracting data from various sources, generating CSV reports, storing them in S3 buckets, implementing notification mechanisms, and ensuring access control.

## Python Scripts or Airflow Tasks

To begin, develop Python scripts or Airflow DAGs to generate CSV reports containing analyzed data. Define the logic for extracting data from sources such as dbt models, Redshift, and PostgreSQL database tables. Utilize libraries like pandas for data manipulation and transformation.

## Scheduled Execution

Schedule the execution of Python scripts or Airflow tasks using cron jobs, Airflow scheduling, or AWS Lambda scheduled events. Determine the frequency and timing of report generation based on business requirements and stakeholder preferences.

## Data Sources

Extract data from dbt models, Redshift tables, and PostgreSQL database tables using SQL queries or data manipulation functions.

## CSV Report Generation

Use pandas or other data manipulation libraries to process and transform the extracted data into CSV format. Define the structure and layout of the CSV reports, including column headers, formatting, and metadata.

## Storage in S3 Buckets

Once the CSV reports are generated, store them in designated S3 buckets for easy access and sharing. Organize the S3 bucket structure based on report categories, time periods, or other relevant criteria.

## Notification Mechanisms

Implement notification mechanisms such as AWS SNS or email alerts to notify stakeholders when new reports are available. Configure automated notifications triggered by the completion of report generation tasks or the arrival of new data.

## Access Control

Ensure appropriate access controls and permissions are configured for the S3 buckets containing the reports. Define user roles and policies to restrict access to sensitive or confidential data and ensure compliance with security requirements.

By following these steps, you can automate the process of generating CSV reports containing analyzed data and distribute them to stakeholders efficiently, ensuring timely access to valuable insights for informed decision-making.
