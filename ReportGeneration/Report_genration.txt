let's break down the process of generating CSV reports for business analysts using Python scripts or Airflow DAGs and scheduling them to run daily in the EAT (East Africa Time) timezone:

Python Scripts for CSV Generation:

Use Python scripts to extract data from various sources, such as dbt models, Redshift, and PostgreSQL database tables.
Utilize libraries like pandas to manipulate and transform the data into CSV format.
Define functions or classes to encapsulate the logic for data extraction, transformation, and CSV generation.
Implement error handling and logging to capture any issues encountered during the process.
Airflow DAGs Setup:

Define Airflow DAGs to orchestrate the execution of Python scripts for CSV generation.
Specify the tasks within the DAGs, including tasks for data extraction, transformation, CSV generation, and file storage.
Configure dependencies between tasks to ensure proper execution order and data flow.
Use Airflow Operators such as PythonOperator to execute Python functions within tasks.
Define task parameters and arguments to pass inputs and outputs between tasks.
Scheduling in Airflow:

Set up a schedule for the Airflow DAGs to run daily at a specific time in the EAT timezone.
Use Airflow's scheduling features, such as cron expressions, to define the execution frequency and timing.
Configure the DAGs to run at the desired time of day, considering any dependencies or constraints on data availability.
Ensure that the Airflow scheduler is running continuously to trigger the DAGs according to the defined schedule.
Airflow Configuration:

Configure Airflow to use the appropriate timezone settings for scheduling tasks in the EAT timezone.
Update Airflow's airflow.cfg configuration file to specify the timezone as 'Africa/Nairobi' or 'EAT' to align with the local timezone.
Verify that the DAGs and tasks are configured to run at the correct time relative to the EAT timezone.
Notification Mechanisms:

Implement notification mechanisms within Airflow to alert stakeholders when the CSV reports are generated successfully.
Configure email notifications using Airflow's EmailOperator or integrate with messaging services like Slack for real-time alerts.
Define thresholds or conditions for triggering notifications based on the success or failure of DAG runs.
Logging and Monitoring:

Set up logging to capture detailed information about the execution of the Python scripts and Airflow DAGs.
Use Airflow's built-in logging capabilities to record task execution status, output, and any errors or exceptions.
Monitor Airflow's web UI and logs to track the execution of DAGs and tasks, troubleshoot issues, and ensure smooth operation.
By following these steps and best practices, you can automate the generation of CSV reports for business analysts using Python scripts or Airflow DAGs and schedule them to run daily in the EAT timezone, providing timely access to valuable insights for decision-making.
