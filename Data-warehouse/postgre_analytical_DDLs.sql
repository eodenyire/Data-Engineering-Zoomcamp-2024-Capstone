these tables cover the reports generated from the SQL queries we discussed earlier. Each table corresponds to a specific metric or analysis, allowing you to store the results in an organized manner for further analysis or reporting purposes. If there are any additional reports or metrics you'd like to capture in your PostgreSQL database, feel free to let me know, and I can assist you in creating the corresponding tables.
