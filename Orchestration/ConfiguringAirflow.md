# Configuring Apache Airflow for DAG Orchestration

To configure Apache Airflow to orchestrate your DAGs, you need to define the DAGs, tasks, and dependencies in Python files and place them in the appropriate directory on the EC2 instance. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to configure Airflow to orchestrate your DAGs:

1. **Define DAGs:** Write Python scripts to define your DAGs. Each DAG script should contain a DAG object that defines the workflow, schedule, tasks, and dependencies. You can use the `DAG()` constructor provided by Airflow to create DAG objects.

2. **Define Tasks:** Inside each DAG script, define tasks using Airflow operators such as BashOperator, PythonOperator, PostgresOperator, etc. Each task represents an individual step of your ETL process. Tasks should perform specific actions such as running scripts, executing SQL queries, or calling Python functions.

3. **Specify Dependencies:** Use the `set_upstream()` and `set_downstream()` methods to specify dependencies between tasks. Dependencies define the order in which tasks should be executed. Tasks with no dependencies can be executed in parallel.

4. **Set Task Parameters:** Configure task parameters such as task ID, task description, task parameters, retries, retries delay, etc., as needed. These parameters define how tasks should behave during execution.

5. **Deploy DAGs:** Place the Python script files containing your DAG definitions in the `dags/` directory within the Airflow installation directory (e.g., `/home/GlobalVISA/airflow/dags/`). Airflow automatically detects DAGs placed in this directory and makes them available for execution.

6. **Start Airflow Scheduler and Web Server:** Ensure that the Airflow scheduler and web server are running on the EC2 instance. Start the scheduler and web server as described in the previous step.

7. **Access Airflow Web UI:** Open a web browser and navigate to the Airflow web interface URL (`http://102.98.31.5:8080`). Here, you can view and manage your DAGs, monitor task executions, and manually trigger DAG runs.

8. **Monitor DAG Execution:** Use the Airflow web UI to monitor the execution of your DAGs. You can view DAG runs, task instances, task logs, and execution status in real-time.

9. **Trigger DAG Runs:** Manually trigger DAG runs from the Airflow web UI or schedule them to run automatically based on the specified `schedule_interval` in the DAG definition.

10. **Troubleshoot and Debug:** If any issues arise during DAG execution, use the Airflow web UI to troubleshoot and debug the problem. You can view task logs, task dependencies, and task execution history to identify and resolve issues.

By following these steps, you can configure Apache Airflow to orchestrate your DAGs and automate your ETL processes effectively. Make sure to test your DAGs thoroughly and monitor their execution to ensure smooth operation.
