Replace "your_ami_id", "your_key_name", "your_subnet_id", and "your_vpc_id" with the appropriate values for your AWS environment. Additionally, replace "your_public_ssh_key" with your SSH public key.

The provided configuration will create an EC2 instance named "AirflowMainPump" running Apache Airflow. The user_data script installs Airflow, initializes the metadata database, and starts the Airflow scheduler and web server. It also sets up a security group allowing SSH access on port 22. Adjust the settings as needed to fit your specific requirements and environment.
